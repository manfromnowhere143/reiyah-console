# Public data custody, 2026-09-06

Document ID: `reiyah.gate-b.public-data-custody-2026-09-06`

Version: `0.1.0`

Lifecycle status: `proposed`

The source policy requires that a source be characterized only from retained bytes, metadata,
access terms, redistribution terms, and digest. A URL alone is not retained evidence, and a source
held only as a pointer may not be described as if retained. This record states the custody state of
every public data source the human-channel and LLM threads use, as found on 2026-09-06, and names
the gaps. It creates no rights, no permission, and no claim.

## Custody states

| Source | Used by | Bytes in public Git | Origin recorded in repo | Terms as asserted by the result | Terms retained | Custody state |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| nuScenes trainval metadata (Motional) | Results A through R, S | no, gitignored | yes, S3 URL and SHA-256 in the handoff | nuScenes terms of use, non-commercial | no | `primary_pointer_only`, digest pinned |
| Detector prediction files (Megvii, Mapillary, PointPillars, FCOS3D run for Result Q) | Results A through R | no, gitignored | yes, `tools/measure/fetch_predictions.py` | per-detector release terms | no | `third_party_unretained` |
| 100-Car Naturalistic Driving Study (VTTI) | H1, H2, H3 | no, gitignored | yes, dataverse DOI `10.15787/VTT1/CEU6RB` and file ids in `human-channel/README.md` | CC0 1.0 | **yes, same day**: publisher record retained, seven local files match its MD5s | `primary_pointer_with_retained_record_and_verified_local_bytes` |
| DCPT L3 takeover dataset | H4 | **yes**: `human-channel/dcpt/README.md`, `TakeoverTime.xlsx`, `information.xlsx`, committed at `215b3b0` | **yes, same day**: Zenodo `10.5281/zenodo.17354775` | CC BY 4.0 as recorded by the publisher | **yes, same day**: record retained, all three files match its MD5s, attribution added to `NOTICE` | `third_party_retained_terms_recorded_by_publisher` |
| BDD-A driver attention (Xia et al. 2018) | H5, H6 | no, gitignored | **yes, same day**: portal `bdd-data.berkeley.edu`, paper arXiv:1711.06406 | Regents' licence: educational, research and not-for-profit use, copying and distribution with notice | **yes, same evening**: Internet Archive snapshot (2023-10-04) of the BDD100K documentation licence page retained under `evidence/sources/` with its digest; it states the licence covers data and labels downloaded from the portal; the live host and portal were unreachable (operator's browser screenshot: certificate common-name invalid) | `third_party_unretained_terms_recorded_from_archive_snapshot` |
| Open LLM Leaderboard v1 per-question results (`open-llm-leaderboard-old`, Hugging Face) | T, U, V, W | no, downloaded at run time | yes, dataset id in the tools | per-model and per-dataset terms on the Hub | no | `third_party_unretained` |

## Same-day closure

The machine record [`evidence/public-data-custody-2026-09-06.json`](../evidence/public-data-custody-2026-09-06.json)
retains the Zenodo and Dataverse publisher records under `evidence/sources/` with SHA-256 digests
and verifies every local and committed payload byte against the publisher's MD5. Findings 1 and 3
below are closed for DCPT and 100-Car on that basis; finding 2 is narrowed to a recorded pointer with
recorded failed retrievals. The findings are kept as written.

## Open findings

1. **DCPT payload in public history without recorded permission.** Three third-party files are in
   public Git. The repository contract permits a third-party payload in public history only when
   redistribution permission and every required attribution are recorded. Neither the licence bytes
   nor the origin are retained, so the CC BY 4.0 assertion in H4 is a pointer-grade statement. The
   payload is already published and history is append-only, so the gap is recorded rather than
   rewritten. Closing it requires retaining the licence text and origin with digests, and adding the
   attribution the licence requires to `NOTICE`. Removal from history, if chosen, is an operator
   decision.
2. **BDD-A origin unrecorded.** Closed the same evening: origin and terms are recorded from a
   retained archive snapshot (above). The portal's own download page snapshot carries the same
   text but also a third party's account details and was not retained; its archive URL is a
   pointer. H5 and H6 may describe the data as research-use under the Regents' licence.
3. **No licence bytes retained for any source.** Every terms statement above is asserted from
   memory of the source page, not from retained bytes. That is sufficient for a descriptive
   `proposed` result on public data and insufficient for any publication or redistribution claim.

## Non-claims

A custody inventory, not a rights determination. It asserts no licence, permission, compliance, or
publication authority, and it modifies no released `1.2` byte.
