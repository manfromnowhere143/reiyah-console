# LLM generalization

The camera-lidar and human-channel work measured the independence assumption in driving. This
thread shows the estimand is not about driving at all: it applies to any two channels a system
calls independent. The largest unmeasured such assumption in AI is the LLM jury, self-consistency,
majority vote, and multi-model cross-checking, all of which assume the models err independently.

## Source

Public v1 Open LLM Leaderboard per-question results (`open-llm-leaderboard-old` on Hugging Face),
MMLU 5-shot, per-question correctness, joined across models by a hash of the example. Same method as
the sensor work: public per-item predictions and the Definition 32 coefficient. No LLM inference.
Result V fits and calibrates a logistic-regression monitor on those outputs, the only model fitting
in this thread, and reports it on a held-out split.

Reproduce: `bdda-venv/bin/python llm-generalization/tools/result_t_llm_independence.py` (downloads
the per-question parquet files from Hugging Face). Result X reads a second jury whose 2024-format
files carry no gold answer; gold is recovered at join time from a 2023-format model on the same
question and checked against every row's own correctness flag.

## Result

- [`RESULT_T_LLM_INDEPENDENCE.md`](RESULT_T_LLM_INDEPENDENCE.md) - seven models, five families,
  13,937 MMLU questions. LLM juries fail together (marginal c = 1.32, every pair above 1); the
  same-kind-vs-cross-kind law replicates (same family 1.52 vs cross family 1.29); the coupling
  survives difficulty conditioning (conditional c = 1.10); and a seven-model jury has the effective
  diversity of 3.6 independent models. The independence assumption is a load-bearing fiction
  wherever redundancy is claimed, in sensors, in the human, and in AI juries alike.
- [`RESULT_U_AGREEMENT_RELIABILITY.md`](RESULT_U_AGREEMENT_RELIABILITY.md) - from measuring joint
  failure to predicting it from outputs alone. When two models agree, they are correct only 64.8% of
  the time (both wrong together 35% of the time), and when all seven agree they are still wrong 10.4%
  of the time. Agreement is a systematically over-trusted signal, and the amount is measurable from
  the outputs with no ground truth, the seed of a live monitor.
- [`RESULT_V_DEPLOYED_MONITOR.md`](RESULT_V_DEPLOYED_MONITOR.md) - the instrument itself. A
  coupling-aware risk estimator, calibrated on a training split and evaluated on a held-out test
  split from outputs alone, beats the naive agreement heuristic on every metric (AUC 0.845 vs 0.719,
  ECE 0.015 vs 0.045). On held-out unanimous items the naive ensemble assigns 0% risk while the true
  wrong rate is 9.5%; the monitor assigns 11.6%, catching the coupled-failure blind spot. Its
  features are channel-agnostic, so the same form applies to two sensors or a human and a machine.
- [`RESULT_W_SECOND_BENCHMARK.md`](RESULT_W_SECOND_BENCHMARK.md) - the red-team. The whole law
  replicates on ARC-Challenge, a different domain: marginal c 1.76 (same 1.87 > cross 1.73),
  conditional 1.05, a six-model jury with the effective diversity of 1.6, and unanimous-yet-wrong
  37% (against 10% on MMLU). On harder material the coupling sharpens. The findings are not an MMLU
  artifact.
- [`RESULT_X_MONITOR_TRANSFER.md`](RESULT_X_MONITOR_TRANSFER.md) - the transfer test, both halves.
  Fitted once on jury A and never refitted, the monitor reads seven models from seven unseen
  families at AUC 0.853 against an in-domain ceiling of 0.856 (ECE 0.032 vs 0.015): channel
  transfer holds. Read on ARC-Challenge it falls to or below the naive baseline and its calibration
  breaks: task transfer does not hold. The instrument is portable across channels and must be
  calibrated on the task it reads.
- [`RESULT_Y_THIRD_BENCHMARK.md`](RESULT_Y_THIRD_BENCHMARK.md) - a third benchmark, HellaSwag.
  Every direction of the law reappears (marginal c 2.32, same 2.43 > cross 2.30, a seven-model jury
  with the effective diversity of 1.28, unanimity on 79% of questions and wrong on 34% of those), and
  the residual beyond shared difficulty is nearly zero (conditional c 1.03). The marginal law is
  robust across three benchmarks; the lineage mechanism is benchmark-dependent and stated so.
- [`RESULT_AC_LLM_INTERVALS.md`](RESULT_AC_LLM_INTERVALS.md) - question-resampled bootstrap
  intervals on every headline quantity, three benchmarks. Every marginal statement holds with a band
  that excludes the null. The same-family excess beyond shared difficulty is 0.058 [0.050, 0.066] on
  MMLU and includes zero on ARC-Challenge and HellaSwag, so Result T's lineage statement is
  narrowed to MMLU.
- [`RESULT_X2_LABEL_FREE_NORMALIZATION.md`](RESULT_X2_LABEL_FREE_NORMALIZATION.md) - the cheap
  fix that would make the monitor portable across tasks, a label-free within-model quantile
  normalization of the margins, does not repair task transfer and costs channel transfer (AUC 0.853
  to 0.787 on the unseen jury). The task failure is a signal problem, not a scale problem.
- [`RESULT_AE_LEAVE_ONE_BENCHMARK_OUT.md`](RESULT_AE_LEAVE_ONE_BENCHMARK_OUT.md) - the last
  transfer question: fitted on two benchmarks and read on the third, the monitor is no better than a
  single-benchmark fit, and on HellaSwag it is worse than chance (AUC 0.37 to 0.39). Fit per task,
  read across channels; the boundary of the instrument is recorded as firmly as its successes.
- [`RESULT_AL_CROSS_JURY_DIFFICULTY.md`](RESULT_AL_CROSS_JURY_DIFFICULTY.md) - difficulty measured
  by an independent jury. Jury A's residual stays at 1.094 [1.088, 1.098] and its same-family excess
  grows to 0.098 [0.089, 0.108]; jury B, seven unrelated families, falls to 1.016 [1.014, 1.019].
  The coupling that survives an independent difficulty measure is concentrated in shared lineage.
- [`RESULT_AI_PREREGISTERED_WINOGRANDE.md`](RESULT_AI_PREREGISTERED_WINOGRANDE.md) - the first
  preregistered test: eight falsifiable predictions committed before the run on a two-choice
  benchmark the program had never examined, eight supported (every pair above 1, minimum 2.26; a
  seven-model jury with the diversity of 2.06; unanimity on 55% of questions, wrong on 10%). Four
  procedural deviations about the archive's file formats, each committed before its rerun.

## Discipline

Public data, descriptive, retained as `proposed`, the marginal coefficient includes shared question
difficulty (the conditional removes the measurable part), a generalization demonstration and not a
driving result. No released `1.2` byte involved.
