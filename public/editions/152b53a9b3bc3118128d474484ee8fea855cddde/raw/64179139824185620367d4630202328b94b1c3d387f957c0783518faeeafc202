# Reiyah

**Decisions under imperfect evidence.**

Reiyah studies how to justify a change to an autonomous system when the evidence
is incomplete or disputed. Its implemented engine compares perception
configurations against shared reference alternatives and returns checked loss
bounds. It distinguishes an improvement supported by the declared evidence from
one that is excluded or remains unresolved.

The intended user is a perception-validation lead deciding whether a detector
replacement or addition merits further integration work. The research objective
is to reach the same justified decision with less total work, including the cost
of obtaining, reviewing and checking the evidence. **An advantage over competent
conventional analysis remains unproven.**

**Current decision: pause broad engine expansion.** Preserve the conditional
research core and negative results. The [current research release](research/releases/2026-10-11/README.md)
contains the claim corrections, reproducible reference-revision results and the
evidence required before product investment resumes.

Perception is the current application within **HARBOR: Human-Automation Readiness,
Belief & Operational Risk**, the proposed wider research program. Its questions
concern what people and automated systems know about the same encounter, when
they miss the same object, and what evidence supports readiness or recovery.
The implemented perception engine and those broader research questions have
different evidence requirements.

## Implemented scope

The wider ambition is a system that helps autonomy teams make consequential
changes on defensible evidence: what improved, where uncertainty remains, and
what observation could change the decision. Each capability must earn its
place through a fair comparison and a useful decision.

| Component | Available today | Evidence boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Perception comparison](research/perception-revision/0.1.0/README.md) | Conditional loss bounds, witnesses, audit certificates and separate checking for declared reference alternatives. | Correctness depends on the input contract; complete-work savings remain unproven. |
| [Measurement and reference analysis](docs/RESULT_AO_REFERENCE_POPULATION_AUDIT.md) | Offline population, matching and joint-error analyses; [replay of saved predictions under two references](research/reference-revision/0.1.0/README.md). | Recorded annotations and scoring conventions do not establish physical truth. |
| [Input accounting](research/extraction-accounting/0.1.0/README.md) | A helper checks expected membership, decoder failures and source/output identities. | Historical consumers have not integrated it; past cohorts and capture synchronization remain unqualified. |
| [Relational motion](research/continuous-envelope/0.1.0/README.md) | Conditional clearance ranges and opposing witnesses under supplied motion, geometry and timing assumptions. | Authored and bounded recorded-data studies; no deployed monitor or physical safety guarantee. |
| [Human belief, readiness and recovery](docs/SCIENTIFIC_CHARTER.md) | Proposed constructs and protocols; historical gaze and takeover-proxy measurements. | No validated belief inference, universal readiness score or demonstrated recovery benefit. |

The engineering contribution is inspectable conditional reasoning. The product
hypothesis is lower complete decision cost. Their evidence is kept separate.

## The decision model

More detections do not necessarily make a better system. An addition can find
an object, introduce a false detection, or change which existing detection gets
matched. A disputed object near the original detector's output can change the
value of the addition even after every object near the added output has been
confirmed.

Reiyah compares both configurations in the same reference world. Each world
specifies one admissible interpretation of the objects and their matching
relationships. Shared uncertainties remain shared across configurations and
scenes where the declared model requires it. Independently choosing favorable
references for the two detectors would answer a different question.

Misses and false positives carry declared nonnegative penalties; both
configurations use the same population weights. For a fixed loss and improvement
threshold `tau`, write:

```text
delta(w) = loss_A(w) - loss_B(w)
lower <= delta(w) <= upper  for every admitted reference world w
```

A checked lower bound above `tau` supports strict improvement. A checked upper
bound at or below `tau` excludes it. Otherwise the comparison remains unresolved.
A loose enclosure alone does not prove that opposing decisions are possible;
that stronger conclusion requires admissible witnesses on both sides. Failed or
unavailable preparations remain recorded separately.

  E --> K["Separate certificate checker"]
  C --> K
  K --> V["Compare decisions and costs<br/>Retain failures, unresolved cases and unknown costs"]
  B --> V
```

The implementation uses exact arithmetic, maximum-cardinality one-to-one
matching and separately checked certificates for the supported bound families. It retains
original records, indices and clocks, with traces from a dependency or adverse
interpretation back to its source. These checks establish a conclusion from
specified operands; the quality of those operands remains a measurement question.
These FP/FN loss bounds are not COCO AP bounds. Greedy confidence-ordered AP
has different matching semantics, as the [matching control](research/matching-bound-control/0.1.0/README.md)
demonstrates.

The [replacement interface](research/perception-revision/0.1.0/README.md)
accepts independently declared A/B outputs, checks conditional reference-audit
sufficiency and verifies whether a certificate remains applicable after a
revision. Reuse requires checking the earlier premises. The
[worked examples](research/perception-decision-review/0.1.0/README.md) explain
matching competition, cancellation of shared uncertainty and dependencies that
must survive aggregation.

## When the reference changes the answer

A prediction can be unmatched because the evaluator excluded a nearby
annotation. Absence from that filtered reference differs from absence in the
complete annotation table. Neither, by itself, establishes absence from the
physical scene.

The [reference-population audit](docs/RESULT_AO_REFERENCE_POPULATION_AUDIT.md)
makes this distinction concrete. At a score threshold of 0.30, **3,151 camera
flags and 5,728 lidar flags** were within two metres of annotations excluded
from the original reference: **12.90% and 24.03%** of the respective unmatched
flags under that historical, any-class distance predicate. The annotation could concern a different
class or object. This result changes the geometric flag; it does not adjudicate
the detection as physically correct.

```mermaid

  N -- "no" --> U["Geometric proximity flag is unchanged"]
  W --> H["Separate sensor review<br/>required for physical interpretation"]
  U --> H
  H --> E["Supported judgment<br/>or an explicitly unresolved case"]
```

The [real-data replay](docs/REFERENCE_AUDIT_REAL_DATA_2026-09-07.md) and
[cache-policy reconstruction](docs/CACHE_SELECTION_AUDIT_2026-09-07.md)
check the calculation and selection policy separately. The prepared
[adjudication study](docs/REFERENCE_ADJUDICATION_STUDY_2026-09-07.md)
contains 240 detections across 93 scenes; independent human judgments remain
unavailable. Preparing an inspection package does not supply those observations.

The distinction also affects the engine's decision. On the retained two-anchor
case, open physical references produce **[-8, 8]**, while supplied benchmark
labels produce **[1, 1]**. The latter is a conclusion conditional on the labels.
It is not a resolution of the former physical uncertainty.

## Measurement before comparison

A comparison needs a defined opportunity population before it can count a miss.
The sensor record, object class, index time, reference selection and matching
policy determine what was eligible to be observed. Changing that population can
change both the numerator and denominator of a reported rate.

```mermaid

```

This diagram describes the measurement sequence. The new
[extraction-accounting helper](research/extraction-accounting/0.1.0/README.md)
checks input consumption, but has not been integrated into all historical
consumers. It does not retroactively validate their inputs or clocks.

An observed empty output, a missing output, an invalid sensor record, an
excluded reference and an unobserved physical object have different meanings.
Unavailable evidence does not become an observed zero. A review must establish
which object, time, class and geometry it actually resolves, and record the
uncertainty that remains.

This is why selecting observations efficiently is only part of the problem.
If two allowed worlds yield the same complete observation transcript but imply
opposing decisions, changing the order of those observations cannot distinguish
them. A different measurement or a justified narrower uncertainty model is
needed. The [observation-contract study](research/observation-contract/0.1.0/README.md)
tests this boundary on the retained timing cases.

## What the joint-error statistic measures

The earlier measurement research asks whether two channels miss the same
reference objects more often than their marginal miss rates would suggest.
For a nonzero marginal product, its coincidence ratio is:

```text
P(A misses and B misses) / [P(A misses) * P(B misses)]
```

The quantities must use the same declared opportunities. Conditional analyses
make the comparison within named strata and retain the support used for
aggregation. The ratio must be read with the absolute joint loss and marginal
rates; it is undefined when the marginal product is zero.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  O["Same declared object opportunities"] --> A["Channel A miss probability"]
  O --> B["Channel B miss probability"]
  O --> J["Observed joint-miss probability"]
  A --> P["Product of marginal probabilities"]
  B --> P
  J --> C["Coincidence ratio<br/>Where the denominator is nonzero"]
  P --> C
  C --> R["Report together<br/>Marginals, joint rate, support and uncertainty"]
  J --> R
```

On the audited camera/lidar population, the conditional ratio is **1.151053**,
with a scene-bootstrap percentile interval of **[1.128749, 1.166206]** under
the recorded sampling procedure. This is a descriptive association on a
particular reference population. The interval does not account for every input
error or establish physical error independence, causality or a vehicle safety
rate. The [audit](docs/RESULT_AO_REFERENCE_POPULATION_AUDIT.md) gives the
population, resampling unit, donor rules and sensitivity results.

The [later comparison](docs/FABLE_RAW_CONSUMER_REVIEW_2026-09-13.md)
retains agreement on 270 selected aggregate comparisons. At exactly matched
marginals, the ordering is algebraically the same as intersection and Jaccard
ordering. Claims that wider coefficient margins established stronger evidence
were withdrawn. The [sign correction](docs/FABLE_SIGN_CONSUMER_REVIEW_2026-09-13.md)
also withdraws automatic identification from adding a third detector.
Those corrections remain part of the research record.

## Current evidence

These results summarize retained work through **11 October 2026**. The linked
records contain their complete assumptions, outcomes, failed attempts and costs.
The rows below concern different, sometimes overlapping development studies;
their counts must not be added as independent trials.

The [September 20 research expansion](research/frontier-expansion/0.1.0/README.md)
adds an offline authored clearance contract for ego and lead-vehicle motion.
All 20 cases agree with a separate conventional calculation, retaining six
unresolved, three blocked and one inconsistent-premise case. This establishes
a small checking capability; it is not a driving-performance or safety result.
The [roadmap](docs/ENGINE_ROADMAP_2026-09-20.md) preserves the wider perception,
relational-motion and recovery vision as historical research direction. Its
current decision stops broad expansion pending evidence of workflow value.

The [continuous uncertainty extension](research/continuous-envelope/0.1.0/README.md)
computes tight minimum-clearance ranges with interval observations, a supplied
relative-motion bound and one shared clock offset. Its twenty authored cases
retain five supported, two contradicted, six unresolved, five blocked and two
inconsistent-premise results. Opposing witnesses make the unresolved cases
inspectable; the supplied assumptions still need physical qualification.

| Question | Retained result | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Does a released reference revision change a saved detector ranking? | COCO to COCO-ReM changes the R101-minus-R50 bbox AP gap from **2.327518 to 2.658695 points**; four of 80 category rankings reverse. | Overall ranking unchanged. Conventional evaluation produces the result; no Reiyah benefit was measured. [Replay](research/reference-revision/0.1.0/README.md) |
| Do per-object overlap bounds automatically bound greedy AP? | In a constructed two-prediction case, nominal AP50 is **1** while the upper-overlap endpoint scores **51/101**. | A correctness control, not an empirical gain, new AP engine or demonstrated defect in another paper. [Control and reproduction](research/matching-bound-control/0.1.0/README.md) |
| Does selected gaze coincidence bound population dependence? | Exact completions move the coefficient both above and below the selected value. | The general lower-bound inference and associated safety credit are withdrawn. [Correction](research/claim-correction/0.1.0/README.md) |
| Can reference assumptions change a detector decision? | The two-anchor interval is **[-8, 8]** with open physical references and **[1, 1]** under benchmark labels. | Physical adjudication remains open. [Case](docs/PERCEPTION_ANNOTATION_CASE_2026-09-14.md) |
| Can an audit's sufficiency be checked? | **372 hypothetical confirmed-present labels** attain a checked minimum on one forty-frame case under its deletion model. | This is conditional sufficiency, not measured sequential query cost or reviewer time. [Proof](docs/PERCEPTION_MONOTONE_AUDIT_2026-09-17.md) |
| Which decisions remain unresolved? | All **1,790 unresolved rows** in the 7,707-row operating study have checked opposing worlds; **2,199 rows remain blocked**. | A distinguishing observation or justified change of assumptions is required. [Outcomes](research/operating-timing-witness/0.1.0/OUTCOMES.md) |
| Would complete presence answers resolve timing uncertainty? | All **623 unresolved partial-timing cases** retain opposing decisions with identical complete presence answers and counts. | The construction permits arbitrarily narrow positive-width boxes. It exposes the model's breadth, not the physical shape of cars or ambiguity of every possible transcript. [Study](research/observation-contract/0.1.0/README.md) |
| Has the engine reduced work against strong alternatives? | Conventional methods attain all **99 resolved query floors**; the small certificate-reuse assay is slower than recomputation. | No selection, stopping or complete-cost advantage is established by those studies. [Comparison](research/roadmap-audit/0.1.0/README.md) · [Reuse](docs/PERCEPTION_REVISION_AUDIT_2026-09-16.md) |
| Do adaptive statistical audits help on the retained perception conditions? | None of the tested statistical arms stops earlier than matched exact stopping on the three exposed 64-image conditions. The study retains **11,712 paths** across its authored and perception populations. | Authored errors, unresolved populations and sampled rather than exhaustive checks remain explicit. [Adaptive comparison](research/adaptive-audit/0.1.0/README.md) · [Earlier methods](research/sequential-audit/0.1.0/README.md) |

A conditional proof, a statistical guarantee and a measurement of physical
correctness answer different questions. Checks performed in this development
process are not independent scientific replication. Lower complete validation
cost remains an open hypothesis. All **1,433 outcome-reserved images remain
closed**.

## One encounter, distinct information sets

HARBOR's unit of inquiry is a particular object, encounter and time. A camera
output, a lidar output, a driver's gaze and a takeover action carry different
information. The proposed architecture separates **observation, latent belief,
decision, intervention, outcome and evidence**. Connecting an observation to
belief or readiness requires a validated measurement model.

The diagram describes the research questions and their dependencies. It does
not represent a deployed inference or vehicle-control system.

Human-channel studies measure gaze and takeover proxies. Language-model studies
measure error coincidence and monitor transfer on archived answer populations.
Their populations and variables remain distinct from human and vehicle belief
in a shared encounter. The [scientific charter](docs/SCIENTIFIC_CHARTER.md),
[corrected synthesis](docs/GENERAL_SYNTHESIS.md) and
[claim register](evidence/claim-status-register-2026-10-10.json)
set out the scope and corrections.

## Evidence architecture and reproducibility

The repository contains static scientific contracts, offline research tools and
retained experiments. Gate A defines versioned contracts, schemas,
counterexamples and locked validation. The research implementation prepares
comparisons, checks certificates and records scoped findings. Their integration
remains incomplete.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  subgraph CONTRACT["Gate A: static contracts"]
    M["Mission, protocol and assumptions"] --> F["Schemas and counterexamples"]

```

Source hashes bind conclusions to particular bytes. They do not establish that
an annotation is true, a population is complete or a conclusion has been
independently reviewed. Passing a checker is evidence about the implemented
contract. **Gate A remains operator-unaccepted**; the repository does not claim
standards compliance or deployment authority.

### Run the offline auditor

From the repository root:

```sh
python3 -B research/perception-decision-review/0.1.0/reproduce.py
```

This reference calculation uses only the Python standard library. It requires
no sensor dataset, model or API key. Its JSON should match the retained
[expected result](research/perception-decision-review/0.1.0/expected.json).
The examples exercise matching ambiguity, shared uncertainty and reference
dependencies.

The [current research release](research/releases/2026-10-11/README.md) also provides
exact correction controls, a small extraction-accounting check and a four-run
[COCO reference replay](research/reference-revision/0.1.0/README.md). The latter
requires externally obtained, byte-verified score and annotation files; these
payloads are not distributed in the repository. No model inference is required.
The separate [matching control](research/matching-bound-control/0.1.0/README.md)
uses authored boxes and the pinned COCO evaluator, with no external dataset.
It follows the October release and is not part of its immutable tag.

The [engine guide](research/perception-decision/0.1.0/README.md) explains how
to produce and separately verify a comparison packet; it also requires
`jsonschema`. The [replacement guide](research/perception-revision/0.1.0/README.md)
adds independently declared A/B outputs and conditional audit certificates.

For repository research-consistency checks, use an environment with `numpy`,
`scipy` and `jsonschema`:

```sh
python3 -B tools/measure/gate_b_check.py --json /tmp/reiyah-gate-b-check.json
```

The default check verifies retained transcript identities and consistency. It
does not rerun the historical experiments. The
[replay manifest](validation/gate-b-replay-manifest.json) records their input
and environment requirements. Gate A release validation uses its own locked
launcher and immutable candidate procedure.

## Next research decision

The [current release decision](research/releases/2026-10-11/README.md#next-scientific-investment)
continues the stop on broad evidence-engine expansion. The claim corrections
are now published. An extraction-accounting helper is implemented and checked;
historical cohorts have not been rerun, and consumer integration and physical
synchronization remain open. The [September stopping point](docs/RESEARCH_STOP_POINT_2026-09-21.md)
records why these corrections were required.

Public data and local compute can support further scientific work. Claims about
a real team's saved effort require actual workflow observations and an
accountable decision owner. Proofs and public retrospective studies can proceed
without an external team. The exposed COCO pair is closed without selector
tuning because conventional evaluation already answers its declared ranking
question.

The next product-value test needs a real revision decision: genuine old/new model
artifacts, an owner-defined loss and operating criterion, a qualified review
process and complete measured costs. Reiyah and the strongest applicable
conventional workflow must receive the same evidence and satisfy the same
correctness and resolution obligations. Preparation, reviewer time, retries,
checking, integration and repair all belong in the comparison.

The primary investment hurdle is **at least halved complete active work**, with
equal decision obligations and no observed false assurance. Threefold fewer
expensive observations is secondary. Neither target has been reached; absence
of observed errors would not establish a safety guarantee. Real revision
histories, human review costs and an owner-approved release criterion remain
missing. The [workflow brief](research/value-disproof/0.1.0/WORKFLOW_BRIEF.md) identifies those
inputs; it is not evidence of a customer engagement. No qualifying record is
currently retained. Further authored examples or exposed parity sweeps cannot
substitute for that missing workflow evidence.

Have an existing comparison or scoring result that could help? The
[short submission guide](docs/SHARE_A_COMPARISON.md) explains which records
support each question and links to a public proposal form. Partial records
and explicit unknowns are welcome; no new model run is requested.

Keep discovery to two engineering days within a fourteen-day window when work
is active. An admitted first screen gets at most five engineering days on CPU.
These are resource limits, not an unattended schedule. If no suitable case is
found, or competent conventional evaluation reaches parity, stop this product
investment and preserve the research.

```

The [next-session brief](docs/NEXT_SESSION.md) states the mission, evidence
standard, case-admission fields and first actions. Cloud infrastructure can
support a justified workload; it cannot supply an unresolved decision or
independent reference evidence. A scientifically useful result can be worth
preserving even when it fails the product-value test.

## Recent research

- **12 October 2026:** [Exact choice: sufficient labels and acquired labels](research/exact-choice-baseline/0.1.0/README.md). A separately checked finite AUGRC baseline distinguishes hindsight certificates from queries a procedure must actually acquire. All 12,700 declared candidate configurations agree; the majority control needs two labels in hindsight and three in the optimal worst case. No complete-work advantage is measured.
- **12 October 2026:** [Frontier methods and the next comparison](docs/research-decisions/frontier-2026-10-12.md). Current autonomy documentation and research sharpen the baseline: shared-evidence certificates already have close prior art. A new value experiment still needs a qualified observation process and complete work records. No comparative advantage is claimed.
- **11 October 2026:** [Consistency and reference agreement favor different saved runs](research/motion-consistency-audit/0.1.0/README.md). On a fixed EgoDyn-Bench pair, trajectory-labeled answers improve reference agreement from 49.78% to 63.61% while WPCR falls from 97.87% to 89.66%. All 28,000 answers and both published metric reports verify. Internal consistency and reference agreement are distinct obligations; no causal effect, driving-safety or Reiyah performance advantage is established.
- **11 October 2026:** [Does the review procedure change the decision?](research/review-procedure-sensitivity/0.1.0/README.md) In a recorded 1,000-object Cityscapes sample, 133 objects have incompatible majority outcomes across proposed-class and no-proposal review under every declared one-response-per-ID choice; 17 have different ordinary class majorities. Separate enumeration verifies all pairs. This establishes recorded procedure sensitivity, not physical truth, a causal effect or work savings.
- **11 October 2026:** [Can the available observations justify a decision?](research/resolution-identifiability/0.1.0/README.md) A finite observation check preserves correlated responses and overlapping acceptable decisions. A separate adaptive-tree calculation agrees across 31,213 authored models; 28 malformed-input and forged-result controls reject. Actual review channels and work savings remain unqualified.
- **11 October 2026:** [Mean errors must not depend on processing batches](research/metric-aggregation-control/0.1.0/README.md). An authored mean-TV comparison reverses when only chunk size changes. Collecting every image's metric arrays restores the detection-weighted means across 90 configurations; 1,656 numeric means and 504 undefined fields verify. AUSRC is unchanged by this correction. Published empirical impact remains unknown.
- **11 October 2026:** [Successful empty outputs and scoring populations](research/empty-output-score-control/0.1.0/README.md). A constructed native AUSRC comparison reverses when an omitted reference image is counted: A changes from 1 to 51/101 while B stays at 0.8. The tested correction preserves nonempty-image tensors; an independent rational checker verifies 51 scores and denominators. Published empirical impact remains unknown.
- **11 October 2026:** [Reference policies can reverse a threshold choice](research/threshold-reference-screen/0.1.0/README.md). Two fixed confidence thresholds exchange preference between COCO and COCO-ReM under equal FP/FN loss. All 20,000 per-image count records verify. In a declared policy-disclosure simulation, a conventional order needs 204 disclosures and the hindsight minimum is 148, leaving at most 1.38× count savings. No complete-work advantage is established.
- **11 October 2026:** [Recorded reviewer identities and majority decisions](research/reviewer-identity-sensitivity/0.1.0/README.md). Counting one observed response per recorded ID preserves the raw majority outcome for 996/1,000 proposed-class and 988/1,000 no-proposal object records. No ordinary class majority can switch directly to another ordinary class. This qualifies a reference-policy sensitivity, not voter independence, physical truth or work savings.
- **11 October 2026:** [Overlap bounds and greedy matching](research/matching-bound-control/0.1.0/README.md). An authored finite counterexample checks a tempting AP shortcut. Native and exact calculations agree; novelty, empirical impact and a Reiyah advantage remain unestablished.
- **11 October 2026:** [Verification metadata clarification](research/releases/2026-10-11/verification-note-0.1.0.json). The retained launch status differs from the completed replay result; the original release tag and scientific results are unchanged.
- **11 October 2026:** [Corrected research release](research/releases/2026-10-11/README.md). Claim corrections, extraction source, portable reference-revision replay, complete result disclosure and current investment limits.
- [21 September: exact native-grid fidelity](research/grid-fidelity/0.1.0/README.md) resolves the exposed replay with 69 logical reveals per method; equal-information comparison remains tied.
- [21 September: complete-cohort mapping decision](research/decision-value/0.1.0/README.md) supports three recorded replacements and leaves one blocked; the competent conventional method agrees.
- [21 September: recorded navigation fidelity](research/navigation-measurement/0.2.0/README.md) supports the fixed recorded requirement; the conventional method uses one fewer logical sample.
- [21 September: navigation measurement attempt](research/navigation-measurement/0.1.1/README.md) retains an initialization-only sample, zero eligible cases and the stronger conventional alternative.
- [21 September: complete measurement resolution](research/measurement-resolution/0.1.0/README.md) checks every feasible response, executes acquisition and retains uncertainty and conventional parity.
- [21 September: nominal separation](research/nominal-separation/0.1.0/README.md) retains a 2.7 cm reversal, full conventional parity and unresolved physical uncertainty.
- **21 September 2026:** [Recorded clock-alignment decision](research/clock-alignment/0.1.1/README.md). No constant offset preserves all 2,504 supported target-to-ego associations; 1,933 earlier targets remain unsupported. Both methods reject after three logical reveals, with no query advantage or physical timing guarantee.

- **20 September 2026:** [Recorded coordinate-export decision](research/compact-motion/0.1.1/README.md). All 4,437 selected ViF-GTAD target records differ between CSV and MAT, by up to 6.63 m under the declared spherical comparison. Both methods reject lossless substitution after one logical reveal; no query advantage or physical clearance claim follows.
- **20 September 2026:** [Physical source qualification](research/physical-source/0.1.0/README.md). Pinned 7V-Scanario metadata supplies a concrete geometry/motion lead. No listed archive fits current limits; physical uncertainty remains unresolved. The retained contract specifies the smallest useful extract.
- **20 September 2026:** [Continuous clearance and distinguishing observations](research/continuous-envelope/0.1.0/README.md). Exact conditional ranges agree with a separate conventional calculation. Six authored ambiguities retain opposing trajectories; the failed control and corrected freeze remain available.
- **20 September 2026:** [Public vehicle-pair qualification](research/public-motion/0.1.0/README.md). Eight fixed NGSIM windows support their sampled longitudinal-proxy statements; all eight physical continuous-clearance claims remain unresolved. The separate conventional calculation agrees.
- **20 September 2026:** [Presence/count answers and timing uncertainty](research/observation-contract/0.1.0/README.md). Opposing decisions can share the same complete presence transcript under the retained optional-box model.
- **19 September 2026:** [Adaptive audit comparison](research/adaptive-audit/0.1.0/README.md). Tested betting methods do not improve query counts on the selected perception conditions.
- **19 September 2026:** [Sequential audit methods](research/sequential-audit/0.1.0/README.md). Exact checks on authored populations distinguish method validity from practical value.

The [earlier research narrative](docs/README_RESEARCH_HISTORY_2026-09-19.md)
retains the complete pre-reorganization README, including the historical
research-lane arrangement. The [handoff](docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md) carries
current continuation instructions. Neither a new date nor a new test count
changes the scope of an earlier result.
